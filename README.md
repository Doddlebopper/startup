#startup Dave's Skip Policy Website


Elevator Pitch:
Dave is my uncle who has an affinity to skipping the person in the lead whenever we play the game Phase 10. He has such an affinity for it, that he has created his own rulebook that contain his various rules for when he plays Phase 10. I am going to create a website that will allow not just Dave, but anybody on the website to press a SKIPPED THE LEADER button that will increment a counter permanently that can be pressed whenever someone has skipped the leader. In addition to this, I will create a score counter for up to 4 players that will keep track of each persons score when the user updates it.

It's my Uncle's personal website.![CS260 Startup Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122325330/215030090-06cd3a37-c3fd-49af-abe1-f10797269c37.png)

What I have learned notes:

./deployFiles.sh -k ~/downaloads/production1.pem -h davesskippolicy.net -s simon // creates a new "website" of sorts that puts all of the files from the simon into.
